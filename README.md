# Recursion

- In a file called sum_recursion, create:
- a function that takes a list of integers and an integer as 2
arguments. The integer will represent an index point.
- This function needs to add the sum of all the numbers in the list
up until and including the given index point by making use of
- recursion and no loops.
- Examples of input and output:
adding_up_to([1, 4, 5, 3, 12, 16], 4)
=> 25
=> adding the number all the way up to index 4 (1 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 12
